\begin{abstract} 
Use this template to write your final report for CIS 419/519.  It is based on the paper template used in the International Conference on Machine Learning, one of the main machine learning conferences.
\end{abstract} 



\section{Final Submission}

Your final submission will consist of two deliverables:  (1) a final report, and (2) a set of summary slides.  Remember that late days cannot be used for
the final project submission.

\subsection{Final Report}

Your final project report can be at most 4 pages long (include all text, appendices, figures, and anything else), with 1 additional page that can contain nothing but references, and must be written in the provided \LaTeX\ template. 

At a minimum your final report must describe the problem/application and motivation, survey related work, discuss your approach, and describe your results/conclusions/impact of your project.  It should include enough detail such that someone else can reproduce your approach and results.  For inspiration on what should be included, see the links provided on the project description.  You will likely end up with a better report if you start by writing a 6-7 page report and then edit it down to 4 pages of well-written and concise prose.

In addition, your report must also include a figure that graphically depicts a major component of your project (e.g., your approach and how it relates to the application, etc.).  Such a summary figure makes your paper much more accessible by providing a visual counterpart to the text.  Developing such a concise and clear figure can actually be quite time-consuming; I often go through around ten versions before I end up with a good final version.

After the class, we are also considering posting the final reports online so that you can read about each othersÕ work. If are okay with having your final report posted online, be sure to give us explicit permission to post it in the README file, as described in the project description.

\subsection{Summary Slides}

In addition to the final report, you are also required to prepare a two-slide overview of your project.  Details on the summary slides are available in the project description.

\section{Optional Suggestions for Your Paper and Formatting Guidance} 

\subsection{Figures}
 
You may want to include figures in the paper to help readers visualize
your approach and your results. Such artwork should be centered,
legible, and separated from the text. Lines should be dark and at
least 0.5~points thick for purposes of reproduction, and text should
not appear on a gray background.

Label all distinct components of each figure. If the figure takes the
form of a graph, then give a name for each axis and include a legend
that briefly describes each curve. Do not include a title inside the
figure; instead, be sure to include a caption describing your figure.

You may float figures to the top or
bottom of a column, and you may set wide figures across both columns
(use the environment {\tt figure*} in \LaTeX), but always place
two-column figures at the top or bottom of the page.

\subsection{Algorithms}

If you are using \LaTeX, please use the ``algorithm'' and ``algorithmic'' 
environments to format pseudocode. These require 
the corresponding stylefiles, algorithm.sty and 
algorithmic.sty, which are supplied with this package. 
Algorithm~\ref{alg:example} shows an example. 

\begin{algorithm}[tb]
   \caption{Bubble Sort}
   \label{alg:example}
\begin{algorithmic}
   \STATE {\bfseries Input:} data $x_i$, size $m$
   \REPEAT
   \STATE Initialize $noChange = true$.
   \FOR{$i=1$ {\bfseries to} $m-1$}
   \IF{$x_i > x_{i+1}$} 
   \STATE Swap $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$
   \STATE $noChange = false$
   \ENDIF
   \ENDFOR
   \UNTIL{$noChange$ is $true$}
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
 
\subsection{Tables} 
 
You may also want to include tables that summarize material. Like 
figures, these should be centered, legible, and numbered consecutively. 
However, place the title {\it above\/} the table, as in 
Table~\ref{sample-table}.
% Note use of \abovespace and \belowspace to get reasonable spacing 
% above and below tabular lines. 

\begin{table}[t]
\caption{Classification accuracies for naive Bayes and flexible 
Bayes on various data sets.}
\label{sample-table}
\vskip 0.15in
\begin{center}
\begin{small}
\begin{sc}
\begin{tabular}{lcccr}
\hline
\abovespace\belowspace
Data set & Naive & Flexible & Better? \\
\hline
\abovespace
Breast    & 95.9$\pm$ 0.2& 96.7$\pm$ 0.2& $\surd$ \\
Cleveland & 83.3$\pm$ 0.6& 80.0$\pm$ 0.6& $\times$\\
Glass2    & 61.9$\pm$ 1.4& 83.8$\pm$ 0.7& $\surd$ \\
Credit    & 74.8$\pm$ 0.5& 78.3$\pm$ 0.6&         \\
Horse     & 73.3$\pm$ 0.9& 69.7$\pm$ 1.0& $\times$\\
Meta      & 67.1$\pm$ 0.6& 76.5$\pm$ 0.5& $\surd$ \\
Pima      & 75.1$\pm$ 0.6& 73.9$\pm$ 0.5&         \\
\belowspace
Vehicle   & 44.9$\pm$ 0.6& 61.5$\pm$ 0.4& $\surd$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{sc}
\end{small}
\end{center}
\vskip -0.1in
\end{table}

Tables contain textual material that can be typeset, as contrasted 
with figures, which contain graphical material that must be drawn. 
Specify the contents of each row and column in the table's topmost
row. Again, you may float tables to a column's top or bottom, and set
wide tables across both columns, but place two-column tables at the
top or bottom of the page.
 
\subsection{Citations and References} 

Please use APA reference format regardless of your formatter
or word processor. If you rely on the \LaTeX\/ bibliographic 
facility, use {\tt natbib.sty} and {\tt icml2014.bst} 
included in the style-file package to obtain this format.

Citations within the text should include the authors' last names and
year. If the authors' names are included in the sentence, place only
the year in parentheses, for example when referencing Arthur Samuel's
pioneering work \yrcite{Samuel59}. Otherwise place the entire
reference in parentheses with the authors and year separated by a
comma \cite{Samuel59}. List multiple references separated by
semicolons \cite{kearns89,Samuel59,mitchell80}. Use the `et~al.'
construct only for citations with three or more authors or after
listing all authors to a publication in an earlier reference \cite{MachineLearningI}.

The references at the end of this document give examples for journal
articles \cite{Samuel59}, conference publications \cite{langley00}, book chapters \cite{Newell81}, books \cite{DudaHart2nd}, edited volumes \cite{MachineLearningI}, 
technical reports \cite{mitchell80}, and dissertations \cite{kearns89}. 

Alphabetize references by the surnames of the first authors, with
single author entries preceding multiple author entries. Order
references for the same authors by year of publication, with the
earliest first. Make sure that each reference includes all relevant
information (e.g., page numbers).
